# About the Data
This repository host the de-identitified data from researches on https://bestbanana.cc

Meta data is located on the second sheet of each excel.

The column "Intervened" is 1 if the score of the semester is no less than 70, which is considered as exposed enough to the course intervention--otherwise it is 0.

Note the \_pre\_trapped\_ as well as \_pst\_trapped\_ questions is hidden among the question columns. We didn't move it to the front to align it with the original questionnaire. Make sure you handle them first.

In the meta data sheet, the column "Participant" is the number of all course students who we invited to fill out the survey; The column	"Response" represents the count of responses we received; The column "Rate" is simply the quotient of the participants over the responses; The column "Respond_twice" shows the number of people who did both the pre- & post-survey.
